	"ReMark": "I tried to create a sdxl version of DucHaiten-Real3D-NSFW, but it turned out to be much more difficult, because I didn’t just want a 3D style DucHaiten-RealNSFW-XL model, but wanted it to be a Something groundbreaking in every aspect, a model that anyone working on NSFW must use, either for mergers or a model base for training. After 16 different training sessions and dozens of edited versions, I can only temporarily release a beta version for everyone to try. I can only say that I will continue to research and release the official version as soon as possible, or at least the next beta versions, but I have to say that this is really a waste of money. I hope I won’t disappoint myself and everyone else.Attention: remember it’s still just a beta version.Pls use hires fix with adetailer, strictly prohibit using face fix it’s so bad, it makes me embarrassed"
