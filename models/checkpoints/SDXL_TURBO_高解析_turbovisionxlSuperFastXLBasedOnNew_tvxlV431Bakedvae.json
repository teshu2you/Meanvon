	"ReMark": "Super fast generations at 'normal' XL resolutions with much better quality than base SDXL Turbo!Suggested settings for best output Sampler: DPM++ SDE or DPM++ SDE Karras Steps: 3 - 5 CFG: 1 - 2.25 You can run this model in Automatic1111 like a normal XL model, however not all samplers work with it. I've found DPM++ SDE is the best output performance in the 3 - 5 range, while DPM2 looks really good in the 6 - 10 step range if you're willing to wait just a bit longer. The LCM sampler and Euler A produce almost identical output, which is usable at low steps, but really lacking in detail vs. the other options. LoRAs work fine, I've tested multiple LoRAs and they appear to still produce expected results, tho YMMV of course. Coherence is a work in progress with this model. 1024 x 1024 is pretty well solved now, and I very rarely see errors even in 4:3 and 2:3 formats. 16:9 does result in some twinning, but it's not too bad. 21:9 is rougher with an annoying amount of twinning and errors, though not too much worse than normal mainline models.NOTE ON LICENSING - This model is based on the SDXL Turbo model released by Stability AI. They have flagged the model as being released under a non-commercial research license and permits personal, non-commercial use only. Be aware this model cannot be used for image generation services at this time. If you have questions, please reach out to me on Discord."
