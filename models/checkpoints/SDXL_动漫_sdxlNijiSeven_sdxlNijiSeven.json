	"ReMark": "-This version is very different because it is based on NijiV6 To be more precise, around 1000 images from NijiV5 and 1600 from v6 (compared to a total of 1300 images in v6).-I chose not to use the expressive style of NijiV5 this time. But maybe I will add it in a 7.5 version in the future.-There is no longer a trigger word-Version 6 is very different so I still recommend it.Some tips for use:-Don't hesitate to play with things like: realistic, hyper realistic, anime studio, digital artwork, illustration...."
