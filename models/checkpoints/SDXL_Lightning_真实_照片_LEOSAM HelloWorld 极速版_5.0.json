	"ReMark": "This model is a run-accelerated version of the HelloWorld SDXL base model, incorporating both SDXL-Lightning technologies. Equipped with the Eular a sampler and CFG 1, it is capable of generating images in 6-8 steps, which is three times faster than the original SDXL version. Moreover, upon comparison, its imaging results are superior to those of LCM or Turbo versions."
