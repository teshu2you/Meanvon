	"ReMark": "since i'm low on time, i skipped training for SDXL and found the awesome Model LEOSAM's HelloWorld XL from @LEOSAM which is pretty perfect. So i decided to merge it with V1 + a WIP finetuned model around. I wouldn't say it is better in comparsion to LEOSAMs Model, so i would recommend you to use his model instead of mine. If SDXL can get better, look out for this guy ðŸ˜Š Regards for all your love and support "
