	"ReMark": "Deep under a mountain lives a sleeping giant, capable to eighter help humanity or create destruction...This SD 1.0XL-Checkpoint is capable to produce nearly everything.. Colossus is very good creating extremly realistic pictures, anime and art.This is a merge of my best models I have created so far. Its heavily based on Hephaistos V3.31 and The Talos Project (This is a project I have created with freek22). Then I added parts of my Asmodeus 3.0 model (which isn't released yet). To improve some skin textures I added a small percentage of the Realistic Stock Photo model and Newdawn XL..This version is another nearly fully trained model. In addition it combines parts of my Hephaistos_LCM_hybrid model https://civitai.com/models/200061/hephaistosnextgenxl-lcmbf16hybrid and Gleipnir by freek22 https://civitai.com/models/175094/gleipnirThe result is a model capable to do very low steps while giving the possibility to gain even more details on more steps. I have added a small steps/cfg scale to the showcase. It uses DPM++ SDE from a range from 5 steps to 60 steps and a cfg range from 1 to 20 cfg. It works well with A1111/Comfy/Foocus (just turn off all styles and Loras) I highly recommend to use a -2 Clip skip with this version."
