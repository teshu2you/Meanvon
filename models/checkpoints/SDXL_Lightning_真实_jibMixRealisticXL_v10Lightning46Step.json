	"ReMark": "Important: VAE is already baked in.This is a Merge model of many of my favorite realistic SDXL Models (and some more artistic models put in for style and consistency) and I really like the output it makes.Version 10: Is merged with the SDXL Lighting Lora. (If you want to do non photographic artworks like Watercolours, you should stick with version 9 I think.)You need to use a CFG of :CFG: 1-2 and can use steps a low as: Steps: 4-8 and DPM++ SDE Sampler is best."
