	"Usage_Tips": "Turbo version should be used at CFG scale 2 and with around 4-8 sampling steps. This should work only with DPM++ SDE Karras (NOT 2M). You can use this with LCM sampler, but don't do it unless you need speed vs quality.Sampler comparison at 8 steps: h66ttps://civitai.com/posts/951781",

	"ReMark": "You can use the Turbo version (not Lightning) as a non-Turbo model with DPM++ 2M SDE Karras / Euler at cfg 6 and 20-40 steps. Here is a comparison I made with some of the best non-Turbo XL models (with regular settings and turbo settings): h66ttps://civitai.com/posts/1414848 I have no idea why anyone would prefer 40 steps over 8, but you have the option."
