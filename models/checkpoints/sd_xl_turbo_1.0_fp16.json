	"ReMark": "SDXL-Turbo is a distilled version of SDXL 1.0, trained for real-time synthesis. SDXL-Turbo is based on a novel training method called Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD) (see the technical report), which allows sampling large-scale foundational image diffusion models in 1 to 4 steps at high image quality. This approach uses score distillation to leverage large-scale off-the-shelf image diffusion models as a teacher signal and combines this with an adversarial loss to ensure high image fidelity even in the low-step regime of one or two sampling steps."
