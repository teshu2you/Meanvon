	"ReMark": "Hassan SDXL NSFW Model Release: Starting model I am excited to announce the release of our first SDXL NSFW model and LORAâ€™s! This release has been specifically trained for improved and more accurate representations of female anatomy. As always, our dedication lies in bringing high-quality and state-of-the-art models to our users so this model is far from complete, itâ€™s simply the first version of early access while I continue refining it.I value your support, and as a token of appreciation, I originally had this as exclusive early access to my patrons for 2 months.How to get access to future early versions?Head over to our Patreon: h66ttps://www.patreon.com/sd_hassan Ensure that you are subscribed, higher tiers gain access at earlier times than lower tiers.Request access to any release by providing huggingface with the same email address you used for supporting us on Patreon.ðŸ“¦ Whatâ€™s Inside the Release?13GB Model Checkpoint: Gain access to the modelâ€™s comprehensive checkpoint, allowing for advanced deployments, fine-tuning, and custom integrations.Multiple Variations of LORA: Can be used independently or combined with the checkpoint.See Samples you can see samples from the model here in my Patron post or in the gallery here on Civitai h66ttps://www.patreon.com/posts/sdxl-training-89256045Note that I have used simply the prompts I have trained, these examples can be vastly improved by using more positive prompts, negative prompts or extra tools such as Controlnet/Adetailer.Iâ€™m also including all the LORAâ€™s with the same dataset at various epochs"
