	"ReMark": "HelloWorld 7.0 Update - June 13, 2024 One-sentence update summary: HelloWorld 7.0 is an iteratively optimized version, with the best body performance in the entire series, and further enhanced concept scope and detail richness.Update details:By adding negative training images, strengthening pose training, and optimizing the clip model, the accuracy of the model's limbs and hands has been improved compared to previous versions. The recommended negative prompt words are: 'bad hand, bad anatomy, worst quality, ai generated images, low quality, average quality'.Extracted the fine-tuned LoRA from the official SPO model and incorporated it into HelloWorld 7.0. SPO is a further improvement of the DPO method. The SPO base model is used for better performance than the DPO XL base model and the original SDXL base model. The SPO LoRA can enhance image details & contrast and beautify images. Thanks to the technical team behind SPO.Continued to expand the concept scope of the training set, but optimized and streamlined the training set (large training set fine-tuning is too expensive, and H800 is difficult to rent recently, can't afford the local training time). The current total training set is 20,821 images. The training set resolution distribution is as follows, and it is recommended to use several resolutions with a larger number of images for output:"
