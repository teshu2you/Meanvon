	"ReMark": "Consider using DPM++ 3M SDE Exponential for this model, I personally like it best for a wide range of styles. Make sure to read the prompt advice further on in this section if you want to create photorealistic images as well as some of the sample images.For anyone wondering - I will not be supporting the merging of LoRAs such as Lightning, which quickens rendering speed at a loss of significant quality and flexibility, into checkpoints. Read my further thoughts in this article. Read further in this section for settings if you use the Lightning LoRA in conjunction with this model.I've decided to once again share my prompts, both due to CivitAIs improvements on this matter and hopefully less comments of reproduction issues. As a reminder, due to the various workflows, internal settings, UIs, etcetera... copying a prompt will not necessarily get you the same result as another.This model will always remain publicly available for download. It is important to note in this scene that full exclusivity will never be considered. If you have any commercial proposals or are interested in engaging in commercial activities beyond simply selling images created with the model, I encourage you to contact me through Discord. I am open to further discussions and exploring potential collaborations in these areas."
