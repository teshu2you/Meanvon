	"ReMark": "A model created from the original pony model and combined with my various models. I tried to keep almost all of pony's text encoder and only change the image data, so I recommend you learn more about pony if you don't know how to use tag score properly. When using this model, you will feel that the image is less random and don't has too many unnecessary details like the pony, and will feel smoother and cleaner, Eliminates the possibility that some prompts will produce harsh images or burnt colors, the face is made clearer, the hands, feet, and pose are adjusted for fewer errors. But if you gain one, you lose the other. It can only be said that each person has its own style, depending on your preferences."
