	"ReMark": "Yamer's Realistic is a model focused on realism and good quality, this model is not photorealistic nor it tries to be one, the main focus of this model is to be able to create realistic enough images, the best use with this checkpoint is with full body images, close-ups, realistic images and beautiful sceneries, for example futuristic cities or insides of a home.Give this model a chance and let your creativity guide you and the perception you have on the world! After some time I decided to make some change in the way I release models, the new version will be released in 3 separate models, these 3 models while being similar can still be better with some prompts, that is why it is up to you to decide which is better.The new version 5 is separated in: TX, SX and RX.One version can be better with colors or saturation than the other 2; The prompt used in this example is the same, steps, seed and sampler were the same for all images.Version RX (Realistic + RunDiffusion), SX and TX have been uploaded, enjoy all the current versions of the checkpoint!"
