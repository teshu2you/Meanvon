	"ReMark": "Hi all ! Special Edition is available!What's new?-the special edition has really better quality and also much less problem. This is the model as I would have liked to release it.A few tips for use:-Simple prompts can do wonders. When I say prompt simple, I mean don't add words like detailed, realistic or don't ask for a specific artist. Simply describe what you want to see -A cfg scale between 3 and 8.5 works (I recommend 7)-A minimum of 36 steps -Works great with Hires fix -Works great with unaestheticXLv31 embedding. The results are also very good without, sometimes better.-Sampling method: DPM++ 2M SDE Karras or DPM++ 2M Karras Have fun ! ðŸ˜Š"
