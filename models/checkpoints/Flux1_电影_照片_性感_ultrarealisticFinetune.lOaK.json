	"ReMark": "What's New in v2.0?Enhanced Anatomy: Hands, feet, and poses have seen major improvements, offering more natural and accurate results. Say goodbye to overly distorted limbs!Improved Textures & Quality: Upgraded skin details, richer textures, and sharper results overall. Blurred images still happen occasionally, but much less frequently than in the previous version or when using LoRAs alone.Improved Text Rendering: Efforts have been made to improve the generation of text in images, and it’s much better than before. However, artifacts can still occur, and strange symbols might sometimes appear instead of readable words. This remains a work in progress.Expanded Dataset: A larger and more diverse dataset (1800 images) introduces better balance across styles, lighting, and compositions.Added Checkpoint Variations To ensure compatibility with different workflows, I’ve included multiple checkpoint variations:BF16 FP8 Quant 8 (Q8) Quant 4 (Q4) F4From my testing, I’ve noticed Quant 8 (Q8) offers slightly better quality than FP8, providing finer details while maintaining manageable resource requirements, but other works nice too. Pick the version that works best for your setup Known Limitations NSFW Capabilities: Still a weak area in this version. However, a minor fine-tune focusing specifically on NSFW content is already in the works. Text Rendering: While text generation is better, occasional artifacts like odd symbols or incomplete words may still occur. But noticied usage of t5xxl fp16 instead of fp8 helps a lot with text Tips for Optimal Results Sampler: Use DPM++ 2M samplers for smooth and consistent outputs.Steps: Aim for 30–50 steps to capture finer details without over-processing.Scheduler: Beta Scheduler remains the best choice for this checkpoint.Prompting Tips The best prompting style involves complex prompts with clear, comma-separated phrases. While you can get creative with storytelling prompts, unnecessary descriptions like “this crap added more vintage to her style” won’t improve the results. Keep it concise and descriptive, focusing on essential visual details for the best output. Future Plans I’m committed to further developing this fine-tune. The next update will likely focus on"
