	"ReMark": "Welcome to Landscape Realistic Max SDXL! This model is the other derivative of the original model ·Landscape Realistic Pro· combined with several other models, including: SDXL-Mix-Dream v1.5, SDXL-Aeromesi v1.0, TalmendoXL v1.1.Something different is that Landscape Realistic Max SDXL will only be able to produce images starting from resolution of 768x768 to 1536x1536. For users who wants to generate 512x512 or images below that resolution please check out the older version[but still updating] Landscape Realistic Pro from my page.Please join our discord server by United DeviantArt AIGC Art Alliance: h66ttps://discord.gg/2PfHqzxVAv, to get most recent updates and more!(Or if you want to hear me spam in the admin channel which is not locked but muted hehe ≥w≤).DISCLAIMER: The first few versions of this model can be unstable in what they output, so the quality is unsure. If you want more stable models please still go to Landscape Realistic Pro."
