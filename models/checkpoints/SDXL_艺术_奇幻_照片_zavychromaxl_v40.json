	"Usage_Tips": "Consider using DPM++ 3M SDE Exponential for this model, I personally like it best for a wide range of styles. Make sure to read the prompt advice further on in this section if you want to create photorealistic images as well as some of the sample images.Recommended settings sdxl_vae.safetensors (baked in).DPM++ 3M SDE Exponential, DPM++ 2M SDE Karras, DPM++ 2M Karras, Euler A Steps 20~40 (lower range for DPM, higher range for Euler).Hires upscaler: UltraMix_Balanced. Hires upscale: Whatever maximum your GPU is capable of, but preferably between 1.5x~2x.  CFG scale 2-12",

	"ReMark": "A model line that should be a continuance of the ZavyMix SD1.5 model for SDXL. The primary focus is to get a similar feeling in style and uniqueness that model had, where it's good at merging magic with realism, really merging them together seamlessly. Of course with the evolution to SDXL this model should have better quality and coherance for a lot of things, including the eyes and teeth than the SD1.5 models. This model has no need to use the refiner for great results, in fact it usually is preferable to not use the refiner. Recommended to use ultimate SD upscaler to get the most amazing results."
