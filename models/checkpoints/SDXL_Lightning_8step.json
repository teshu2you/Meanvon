	"ReMark": "SDXL-Lightning is a lightning-fast text-to-image generation model. It can generate high-quality 1024px images in a few steps. For more information, please refer to our research paper: SDXL-Lightning: Progressive Adversarial Diffusion Distillation. We open-source the model as part of the research.Our models are distilled from stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0. This repository contains checkpoints for 1-step, 2-step, 4-step, and 8-step distilled models. The generation quality of our 2-step, 4-step, and 8-step model is amazing. Our 1-step model is more experimental."
