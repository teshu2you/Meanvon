	"ReMark": "A big thanks for Version 9 goes to RunDiffusion (Photo Model) and Adam, who diligently helped me test :) (Leave some love for them ;) )I'm back so quickly :DThis time I'll spare you a lot of talk. Over the past 2 months, there has been repeated demand for a Turbo and/or LCM checkpoint. However, I wasn't completely convinced by either option. The Lightning LoRA's seem a bit more mature to me and ultimately delivered the best results in tests among these 3 options. Additionally, the fact that I don't have to change the license here is certainly an additional plus for me and for you :)In the end, I decided to take the first step for the 4 Steps LoRA and merged it with Juggernaut V9. However, I will probably also release the 8 Steps version in the next few days. Regarding the fundamental quality, I still recommend the full V9 checkpoint for the best possible quality. But especially for people with less hardware power, this version will benefit them and they will be able to generate images very quickly :) So if you haven't yet had the pleasure of experiencing Juggernaut, this might be the perfect opportunity :)Recommended Settings for the Lightning Version:Res: 832*1216 Sampler: DPM++ SDE Steps: 4-6 CFG: 1-2 Negative: Start with no negative, and add afterwards the Stuff you donÂ´t wanna see in that image. HiRes: 4x_NMKD-Siax_200k with 2 Steps and 0.35 Denoise + 1.5 Upscale"
